What is Panels APK?
Panels APK is an application that allows users to create custom sidebars on their Android devices.

Instead of constantly switching between home screens or searching for apps in the app drawer, Panels APK makes multitasking seamless by placing everything within reach on the edge of the screen.

Panels APK works by allowing users to swipe from the edge of the screen to reveal a sidebar. This sidebar can be fully customized to suit individual preferences, including the layout, size, colors, and items it displays. The app’s minimalist design ensures that it doesn’t interfere with the device’s normal functionality or aesthetics, making it a practical solution for anyone looking to streamline their Android experience.
